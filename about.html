            <p>Cleaner Shrimps was founded by two sisters, Kristen and Dana Mastropole. Their passion for environmental justice and their love of the ocean led Kristen into the field of marine biology and Dana into the field of physical oceanography. <br><br>The story of Cleaner Shrimps is a familiar one. While living abroad, Kristen got a first-hand look at the devastating effects our throwaway culture had on the ocean, and realized how much trouble we would be if we ignored the reality of what was going on. On a trip to Bali, during a time the local residents have aptly nicknamed "Garbage Season", she encountered a sight that she had only before seen in pictures - a beach so littered with garbage that it was impossible to put a foot down without stepping on plastic. From that moment on, she wanted to do something to help combat the plastic pollution crisis. Upon returning home to Hong Kong, she began volunteering with local beach cleanup groups and considered her role in creating plastic waste. When she moved back home to the US, she shared her vision of Cleaner Shrimps with her sister, Dana, who enthusiastically put those ideas into action.

            <h2>The Genesis of Cleaner Shrimps</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="full-text">
            <p>The idea for Cleaner Shrimps came to Kristen after a trip to Bali during "Trash Season." After being horrified by all the garbage she saw washed up on the beaches and floating right offshore in the ocean, she felt the urge to do someting. At the time she was living in Hong Kong, so as soon as she went back she became involved in beach cleanups. Seeing the dedicated groups that gathered to meet every other weekend to pick up trash on the beaches, she wondered if there was a way for likeminded individuals to meet each other. After returning home to the United States, she shared her idea of a social media platform dedicated to helping people interested in litter cleanup with her sister Dana. Dana was currently working in tech, and became really excited about the project. With her enthusiasm, Dana was able to transform the idea of Cleaner Shrimps into a reality. </p>
